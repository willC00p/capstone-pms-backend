## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Mail setup (Forgot Password)

This project uses Laravel Mail for sending password reset codes. By default the `.env.example` contains placeholders for MailHog (local), Mailtrap (recommended for testing), and Gmail.

Quick steps to configure mail locally:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your mail settings. Example using Mailtrap:

	MAIL_MAILER=smtp
	MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
	MAIL_PORT=2525
	MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailtrap_user
	MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailtrap_pass
	MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls

2. Set MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS and MAIL_FROM_NAME in `.env`.

3. Clear and cache config (after changing `.env`):

	php artisan config:clear
	php artisan config:cache

4. Test the forgot-password flow by calling the API endpoint:

	POST /api/forgot-password  { "email": "user@example.com" }

	If configured correctly, the application will send an email containing a 6-digit code (view located at `resources/views/emails/reset_code.blade.php`). Use the code to call `POST /api/reset-password` with `email`, `token`, `password`, and `password_confirmation`.

If email sending fails, the API will return a detailed error message. For local development, using Mailtrap or MailHog is recommended so you can inspect messages without sending live emails.
